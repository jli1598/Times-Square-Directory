				<h1>Getting Around</h1>
				<div class="textpara">
					<p>In most cases, the best way to get directions is to ask Google Maps. Now that the app gets up-to-date information on special conditions like train delays and weekend service changes, 
					it’s a pretty reliable way to see the most direct route via every mode of transportation. The next-best app is <b><a href="https://transitapp.com/">Transit</a></b>, which shows you all the nearest transport lines at a glance, 
					including real location-based wait times for buses. It also gives travel times for multiple modes of transportation, just like Google Maps.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bold">Subways</div>
				<div class="textpara">
					<p>The subway is your best bet for most trips over one or two miles. It’s often faster than a car (but Google will let you compare travel times), and it runs all day and night. 
					It’s a sharper learning curve for new users, but the savings are worth it. Make sure to be familiar with your route, and listen carefully to the train’s announcer. They’ll be hard 
					to understand. Ask someone around you if they understand better; It’s normal for a careful of people to collectively figure out where their train is going. <br>
					<br>Train directions might be indicated as “Uptown” and “Downtown,” “Inbound” or “Outbound, or by their ending borough, such as “Brooklyn-bound.” Never assume these 
					directions mean what you think. Check what direction Google or Transit tells you to go, and cross-reference with a couple of the stops on your route, making sure they’re in the right order. 
					Again, ask someone. Once you get on the train, some of the signs might indicate a different line. Don’t panic. Ask a fellow passenger about the discrepancy.
					If you’re only here for a visit, use your credit card to buy a MetroCard at any kiosk. The 7-day unlimited card is a good deal if you plan to take at least 13 rides. Otherwise, use the <b><a href=
					"http://enterprise.mtanyct.info/MetroCardCalculator/">MTA’s online fare calculator</a></b> 
					ahead of time to figure out how much to put on your card. (The MTA adds a 5% bonus value, so the amount you charge isn’t the amount you actually get on your card.) If you live here, stop 
					using the kiosks! Sign up for an 
					<b><a href= "https://www.easypaymetrocard.com/vector/static/accounts/index.shtml">EasyPay card</a></b> that automatically refills. They come in per-ride and 30-day-unlimited varieties. If you lose your card, you need to call immediately to stop someone else 
					from using it and running up charges. But the rest of the time, it just works. If you have an unlimited card, and someone asks you to swipe them in as you’re leaving the station, do it. They probably need it.
					<br><br>One more app for subway users: 
					<b><a href="http://www.exitstrategynyc.com/">Exit Strategy</a></b> shows what part of the train to board for the fastest exit or transfer. Sadly, it hasn’t been updated since January 2016, but it’s still useful for all but the 
					newest stations.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bold">Buses</div>
				<div class="textpara">
					<p>New York’s buses are underrated. They’re roomy and relatively clean. Many of them run along dedicated lanes, so they aren’t easily stuck in traffic. They’re still a lot slower than the train, but 
					they let in sunlight and cell signals. And in much of Brooklyn, they’re your only decent option. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="bold">Taxis & Ubers</div>
				<div class="textpara">
					<p>Cabs in New York are more difficult to hail in the rain, so when the weather gets wet you probably want to get out the Uber app. Cabs are generally less expensive than Uber, and, arguably, more “New York.” 
					So, they’re a great way to save a little money and experience the city as generations of New Yorkers have: cruising to 
					your destination in a classic yellow cab. So, the good news is, when in New York City, you only have to tap your phone or raise your hand to get a ride. When you combine the advantages of taxis and 
					Uber, you’ll be able to get around the city as quickly, safely, and efficiently as possible. And remember, our staff at any one of our hotels is happy to help you find the best way to your destinations, 
					including help with yellow cabs.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bold">Walking</div>
				<div class="textpara">
					<p>People walk further in New York than most places. So should you! Most of the city is better accessed on foot. And the vast majority of it is safe to walk through, especially during the day or with multiple 
					people. Most of it is safe in the dead of night, which in tourist areas is never very dead. But before you plan a long jaunt through multiple neighborhoods, check with a local, or stick closer to the beige 
					parts on Google Maps. Those mark commercial zones, where there will be more foot traffic. Those areas are safer and they’re usually more interesting.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bold">Driving</div>
				<div class="textpara">
					<p>Don’t bring a car into New York unless you have to. Parking is expensive, and driving is terrible. Most people in the city don’t own cars; many don’t even have a license. Between Uber, Lyft, cabs, and Car2Go, 
					we’re all set.</p>
				</div>
				<br><br>
				
				<h2>5 Tips to SURVIVE in Times Square</h2>
				<div class="textpara">
					<p><b>Tip Number 1:</b> You’ll find a Starbucks, so don’t fret about that one. In fact, there’s a Starbucks approximately every 720 feet, or about every other block or so. There are literally hundreds of Starbucks, 
					so long as you consider anything more than 200 to be in the hundreds. And yes, the majority of those locations have free wifi, which is that extra jolt of happiness you get with your espresso macchiato.<br>
					<br><b>Tip Number 2:</b> There are more redheads in New York City than in any place in the world, except maybe Ireland — and even that’s in contention. (No really, just look around!) Why is this important? 
					Because redheads are known to be fun, most importantly. So if you’re one of the chosen gingers, you’ll feel right at home in the Big Red Apple. You don’t have to hide it under a baseball cap or a head scarf here! 
					They’ll love you all the more.<br>
					<br><b>Tip Number 3:</b> If you’re seeking those half-price tickets, you’ve come to almost the right place… Yes, the TKTS booth is right in the heart of Times Square, at 47th and Broadway. But did you also know that 
					there’s a second location at the South Street Seaport, at 199 Water Street? That’s close to Wall Street and Battery Park, and the lines are never as long as those in Times Square. Venture forth, you’ll 
					be glad you did.<br>
					<br><b>Tip Number 4:</b> Texting while you’re walking is not just a tourist thing. Everyone does it, locals and tourists alike! Do what the locals do and text away! Sure, you’re googling where to find the nearest Sbarro, 
					while the locals are texting their friends to see where they’re meeting for happy hour. But it’s all okay, and we all bump into each other and just keep going. The only difference is that tourists say 
					“excuse me” and the locals don’t bother. (But just don’t forget to look up every once in awhile to notice the Empire State Building.)<br>
					<br><b>Tip Number 5:</b> If you have a fear of those costumed characters that seem to have overtaken Times Square, don’t worry! The City has instituted “designated activity zones” throughout the area, between 42nd and 
					47th Streets. These 400 square foot or so areas are the only places that the performers, tour bus ticket sellers AND the Naked Cowboy can now work at getting your attention. So phew, one more reason to love 
					Times Square! However, if you do get your picture taken with one or two or ten of them, remember that they’re working hard and sweating even more, so tip ‘em!</p>
